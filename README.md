## Hi There 

I'm Stephen. I'm a Data Scientist. I'm obssessed with numbers and concepts. My expertise is in understanding problems at a very deep level and solving them in a meaningful way. My 5+ years of experience in finance, consulting, and tech has shown me patterns in nature tend to be the main drivers of the abstract. Discovering these patterns is what motivates me.
